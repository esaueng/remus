//! Shared loft/sweep/pipe/revolve end-cap construction.
//!
//! A swept/lofted/revolved end is closed by filling its section *boundary* — a
//! ring of chord edges — rather than by reusing the section's own surface.
//! brepkit tessellates and integrates a non-planar face over its full u/v
//! extent rather than clipping to a chord-polygon wire, so a reused parent
//! surface would overfill past the section. Instead: a planar ring gets an exact
//! `Plane` cap (the planar tessellator clips it to the polygon), and a
//! non-planar 4-sided ring is filled by a bilinear patch whose boundary
//! iso-curves are exactly the ring chords (`domain == wire`, so it can't
//! overfill).
