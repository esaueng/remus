//! Healing context: shared state for all fixers.
//!
//! [`HealContext`] carries tolerance settings, the [`ReShape`] tracker,
//! and diagnostic messages.  It is passed through the fix hierarchy
//! (solid → shell → face → wire → edge) so that all fixers share a
//! consistent view of tolerance and accumulated changes.
