//! Faithful guard for the snapClip deepened-notch cut (the stranded-rim case).
//!
//! The cutter is a plain box whose side walls are exactly coincident with an
//! EARLIER cut's pocket walls and whose top floats 0.01 above the old pocket
//! floor. On the two cone (countersink) faces the new wall sections lie on the
//! SAME intersection curves as the old bite's boundary edges, overlapping them
//! on a 0.015 sliver, and the box-top rim section runs almost entirely through
//! the old bite (off-face) with only micro corner-crescent portions on the
//! face. Three conditioning holes broke the split:
//!
//! - sections overhanging the face through an OUTER-wire concavity were never
//!   clipped (the inner-wire air filter only tests holes), so the weave got
//!   off-face rim/tail pieces and emitted the WHOLE face plus disconnected
//!   bite fragments;
//! - registry-presplit section pieces keep their PARENT's pcurve, so their
//!   endpoint UVs evaluate at the parent's endpoints (the B/A ends carried the
//!   rim's B'/A' UVs), disconnecting them from the boundary in UV;
//! - T-junction self-splits minted zero-extent section edges that derailed
//!   the angular walker into degenerate single-edge sub-faces.
//!
//! Fixtures are the tool's EXACT serialized operands (fresh 2026-07-16
//! capture: plate after op-cut-0, first notch-deepening cutter).
