//! Captured-operand regression for the gridfinity "2×1 lite + mid-cell
//! dividers (cols=3)" lip fuse — the first fallback of that scenario's
//! export chain.
//!
//! Operands captured from the live gridfinity tool via the `serializeSolid`
//! wasm binding (byte-exact in-memory arena):
//!   midcell_lipfuse_body = bin box with divider cavities (boxBuilder output)
//!   midcell_lipfuse_top  = stacking lip, translated to its overlap position
//!
//! The lip's base face is a DOWN-facing annulus (outline + throat hole) that
//! the fuse splits with woven divider sections. The hole-promotion pass
//! sampled the loops through the pcurves, which chord Circle2D corner arcs —
//! the throat's corner points poked past the outline's chord-approximated
//! corners, read as "not nested", and the throat was promoted to its own
//! region instead of staying the annulus's hole. The resulting spurious
//! full disc capped the bin interior, the z=13.3 ring edge went three-way
//! shared, the shell partition split, and the #1146 hole-shell fail-safe
//! sent the fuse to a mesh fallback whose open output (free=121) poisoned
//! every downstream boolean through to the STL export (bd=115).
//!
//! With arc-true via-frame sampling in the promotion pass the fuse is
//! analytic and watertight.
