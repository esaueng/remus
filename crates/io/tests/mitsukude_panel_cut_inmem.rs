//! Cutting ONE mitsukude lattice panel out of a 2x2x6 bin body must stay
//! analytic and watertight. Today the raw GFA cut succeeds in ~200 ms with
//! every cone and cylinder preserved but leaves 8 free edges, so the ops
//! validity gate declares it unusable and takes the mesh fallback — which is
//! where the tool-side "kumiko dividers" scenario spends 82 of its 86 seconds
//! (and picks up non-manifold edges from the fallback's own open output).
//! The perf gap IS this correctness gap.
//!
//! The 8 free edges form one connected loop at the stacking-lip transition
//! band on the east wall (x 38.05 / 38.00 planes joined by an r=0.05 arc band
//! and a 45-degree chamfer, y in [-41.75, -40.05], z in [31.53, 34.8]): a
//! strut pocket crosses the three-surface junction and the sub-face patch
//! spanning it is lost. The 8-panel compound cut fails differently (a
//! 4-face, 0.57 mm^3 open hole-shell fragment aborts assembly), but this
//! single-panel loop is the narrow entry point.
//!
//! Operands captured 2026-08-04 from the tool's boolean traffic (call 036 of
//! the "kumiko dividers perforate the compartment walls" main arm, split to
//! its smallest failing subset: the body and panel 1).
