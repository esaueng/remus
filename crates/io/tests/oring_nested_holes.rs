//! Regression: a planar face whose inner wires NEST must tessellate to its
//! true area, not to the outer boundary.
//!
//! Captured from the gridfinity layout tool's `3x3 O-shape (ring)` custom
//! shape, in its minimal broken configuration (flat base, no stacking lip).
//! The bin exported closed-but-non-manifold (88 folded edges) in 64ms — far
//! too fast for a boolean fallback, and indeed the B-Rep is fine: 47 faces,
//! 24 cylinder + 23 plane, no free and no over-shared edges.
//!
//! Everything went wrong on ONE face, the z=21 wall top, whose three inner
//! wires nest: the cavity opening contains the island band around the central
//! 1u hole, which contains that hole. Two separate defects stacked there:
//!
//!   1. Both solid tessellation paths seeded hole flood-removal at each inner
//!      wire's vertex CENTROID. A gridfinity bin is centred on the origin, so
//!      all three concentric wires share the centroid (0,0) — the first flood
//!      took the innermost cell and the other two found it already gone, so
//!      the 13152-unit cavity was never removed at all.
//!   2. Removing a cell per inner wire is wrong regardless of seeding: nesting
//!      alternates material and void, so only ODD-depth wires bound a hole.
//!      Seeding correctly but removing all three erased the island band too.
//!
//! Stored winding cannot classify them — a boolean can emit a hole wound like
//! its outer — so `hole_removal_seeds` decides by geometric nesting depth.
//!
//! Cell areas on that face (outer ~15736): outer..I27 = 595 material,
//! I27..I28 = 13153 void, I28..I29 = 198 material, inside I29 = 1790 void.
//! Before the fix the mesh covered 13944; the true area is ~793 plus the
//! chord approximation of the rounded corners.
