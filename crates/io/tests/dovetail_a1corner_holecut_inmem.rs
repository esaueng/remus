//! Faithful guard for the A1-corner dovetail connector-recess hole cuts.
//!
//! The export chain cuts two rotated recess boxes into the fused corner plate.
//! Each box's slanted side wall receives a 4-section web from the doubled
//! tongue it crosses: a U-chain of three lines plus a plane×cone conic whose
//! far end lands mid-span of the z=0 line section (a T-junction). Two fit-error
//! conditioning gaps broke the split:
//!
//! - the marched conic's endpoint carries ~1e-6 of curve-fit error, so the
//!   T-junction sat above the 1e-7 vertex tolerance and the junction never
//!   formed (the weld now projects unmatched endpoints onto other Line
//!   sections' interiors);
//! - the planar-arrangement rescue bailed because its arc on-plane round-trip
//!   demanded 1e-7 while the fitted conic lies in the plane only to ~1e-6
//!   (the band is now the weld scale, still rejecting genuine straddle arcs).
//!
//! Un-rescued, the angular wire builder walked the CW-boundary slit-web as one
//! grand circuit (every section out-and-back), the cut failed the analytic
//! gate, and the mesh fallback exported a doubled coincident face pair (the
//! scenario's nm=2 STL pin).
//!
//! Fixtures are the tool's EXACT serialized operands (forExport=false variant:
//! post-nub-fuse corner plate + both recess boxes, cut in tool order).
