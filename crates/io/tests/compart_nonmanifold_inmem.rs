//! Faithful repro: the 2×1 compartmented-bin EXPORT goes non-manifold (#1753).
//!
//! Captured the live remus boolean operands (JS monkey-patch over
//! `BrepKernel.fuseWithEvolution` + `serializeSolid`, #915) at the FIRST
//! over-shared result while running the tool's `compartmentBuilder.scenario.
//! manifold` 2×1 case. The over-share is NOT the compartment-cavity cut (that
//! step is clean, free=0/over=0 — see `gridfinity_cavitycut_inmem.rs`) but the
//! FINAL socket-into-body Fuse done at export time:
//!   - `_body.bin`  : the featured bin body (box + cavities + lip), 94 faces
//!   - `_socket.bin`: the 2×2 base socket, 200 faces
//!
//! Root cause (diagnosed, NOT a weld near-miss): the body and socket meet on
//! the coplanar floor at z=5, but their OUTER CORNERS differ by design — the
//! box uses `BOX_CORNER_RADIUS = 3.75` (a cylinder arc) while the socket uses
//! `SOCKET_CORNER_RADIUS = 4` (a chamfer). At each of the 4 corners the body
//! footprint overhangs the socket by ~0.1mm, so the contact is a PARTIAL
//! coplanar same-domain overlap with mismatched curved corner boundaries.
//! `gfa::boolean` dissolves the straight perimeter contact correctly but
//! leaves 20 free corner edges (5 per corner): the body corner-cylinder
//! bottoms and socket corner-chamfer tops have no shared partner and no step
//! face is synthesised across the 0.1mm ledge. The free-edged shell is
//! rejected by `operations::boolean`'s acceptance gate → mesh fallback →
//! non-manifold (over-shared) result.
//!
//! Near-dup free-endpoint scan = 0 and the gap is ~1.27mm at the corner
//! diagonal (>> any weld tolerance), so this is NOT the #859/#867 weld family.
//! Fixed by synthesising the overhang remainder cap face: the assembler now
//! caps closed planar loops of free edges that lie in a partial-overlap
//! same-domain plane (`cap_partial_overlap_free_loops` in `builder_solid.rs`),
//! reusing the existing edge entities so the loop becomes manifold.
