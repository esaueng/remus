//! Faithful regression guard for the baseplate doubled-dovetail groove cut.
//!
//! The gridfinity tool's `baseplateGenerator.scenario.dovetail.test.ts`
//! "preferIdenticalPieces produces a watertight STL" (a 4x4 interior tile where
//! EVERY cell boundary on a join edge carries both a tongue and a groove)
//! reported 23 non-manifold STL edges with remus and fell back to a slow mesh
//! repair (251 non-manifold edges during winding repair). Capturing the tool's
//! literal kernel operands (via `serializeSolid`, replayed through
//! `arena_io::deserialize_solid`) localized the defect to the FIRST groove `Cut`
//! on the tongue-fused doubled slab — NOT the tongue fuses (which are all clean).
//!
//! The two `.bin` fixtures are the tool's EXACT operands for that cut:
//!   `_slab`   = the 4x4 baseplate slab after its dovetail tongues are fused
//!               (266 faces, watertight). Its z=0 top cap is a single multiply-
//!               connected plane face: 64 outer edges + 16 cell-opening inner
//!               wires (each an 8-edge rounded square).
//!   `_groove` = the female dovetail groove cutter (a 6-face trapezoidal box at
//!               one corner) that pokes through the slab from above.
//!
//! ROOT: the groove cut splits that 16-hole top cap. The holed-plane arrangement
//! split path (`face_splitter::arrangement_regions_from_combined`) wove ALL 16
//! holes into the arrangement even though the corner groove interacts with only
//! one cell. Two bugs compounded:
//!   1. The even-odd "drop a region that fills an original hole (air)" test
//!      probed the OUTER polygon centroid, which for the large holed cap lands
//!      inside one of its OWN cell openings -> the entire material cap was
//!      dropped (free edges along every hole boundary).
//!   2. Chord-fragmenting the 15 untouched arc-bounded cell openings produced
//!      spurious sliver regions that double-emitted hole edges (over-shares).
//!
//! The fix (`face_splitter`): weave only the holes a section actually interacts
//! with; attach the untouched holes whole (preserving exact arc geometry); and
//! run the air-region drop test at a MATERIAL seed (outside the region's own
//! inner-wire holes) rather than the naive outer centroid.
//!
//! This guard asserts the cut is watertight (no free edges), manifold (no
//! over-shared edges), stays analytic (all-planar, no mesh fallback), and is
//! compact.
