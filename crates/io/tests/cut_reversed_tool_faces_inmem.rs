//! Guard for cut results whose tool solid carries faces stored with
//! `is_reversed = true`, replayed from the gridfinity tool's literal kernel
//! operands (captured via the arena serializer during a tool probe).
//!
//! The cavity tool here is a compartment pocket whose three side walls are
//! planar NURBS extrusion faces stored reversed (surface normal opposes the
//! effective outward direction). The GFA assembler's Cut step built flipped
//! copies of kept tool faces with `Face::new_reversed` unconditionally — a
//! SET, not a TOGGLE — so an already-reversed tool face came out of the cut
//! unchanged, its effective normal pointing INTO the result material. The
//! B-Rep still paired every edge (the pairing walk is orientation-blind),
//! but the tessellation emitted those walls
//! wound backwards: 12 one-sided mesh edges at every deflection, an STL that
//! slicers flag as non-manifold, and a mesh volume short by the inverted
//! walls' contribution.
