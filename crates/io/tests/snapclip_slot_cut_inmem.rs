//! Faithful guard for the snap-slot hole cut into a socketed plate edge.
//!
//! A snapClip baseplate cuts 44 plain-box slot cutters into its join edges
//! after the socket pockets. The first slot's cut exercised four stacked
//! section-machinery gaps at the plate's edge-junction web (the face between
//! two socket-bite circles at a join-edge cell corner):
//!
//! - the per-face section clip picked the OUTERMOST crossing pair, which is
//!   only right for convex corner arcs — the web's INWARD-bulging bite
//!   circles made the chord crossings overshoot into air (sections extended
//!   0.65-4.6 past the true material);
//! - a section crossing the face in TWO material windows kept only one;
//! - plane×band (cylinder/cone) Line sections were never clipped to the
//!   band's v-window, arriving overlong on the slot wall;
//! - marched-NURBS section endpoints differ from their exact chain partners
//!   by the curve-fit error (~1e-6), above the 1e-7 vertex quantization, so
//!   the wall's silhouette chain never formed junctions and pendant removal
//!   dropped it whole.
//!
//! Together: 17 unpaired edges → GFA gate → mesh fallback (F=7356) whose
//! open output poisoned the remaining 43 slot cuts. Fixtures are the tool's
//! EXACT serialized operands (5×4 snapClip plate after all pocket cuts, plus
//! the first slot cutter).
