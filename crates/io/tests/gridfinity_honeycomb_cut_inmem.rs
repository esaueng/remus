//! Captured-operand regression + documented residual for the gridfinity "A2"
//! bin: width 2, depth 2, height 4, 2×1 compartments, stacking lip, honeycomb
//! wall pattern, four u-shape wall cutouts.
//!
//! Operands captured from the live gridfinity tool via the `serializeSolid`
//! wasm binding (byte-exact in-memory arena, no geometry re-derivation):
//!   a2hcomb_prewall_body = body box + stacking lip (shell stage output)
//!   a2hcomb_wcut0/1      = the two wall-cutout cut tools
//!   a2hcomb_pcut0..3     = the four honeycomb wall-pattern cut tools
//!
//! The tool's boolean stage runs, in order: first the wall cutouts
//! `Cut(Cut(body, wcut0), wcut1)`, then the honeycomb pattern as one
//! `cutAllBisect` pass `Cut(result, pcut0..3)`.
//!
//! #923 WIN (regression guard). The wall cutouts are now WATERTIGHT and
//! analytic after #923: `Cut(Cut(prewall_body, wcut0), wcut1)` gives 156
//! faces, 52 curved, free=0. Before #923 the second wall-cut dropped a
//! contained back-wall, leaving the body open (the A2 bin mesh-fell-back).
//! `wallcut_step_is_watertight` locks this in for the exact A2 honeycomb-bin
//! operands (a different capture than `gridfinity_wallcut_seq_inmem`, which
//! uses the same tool but no honeycomb).
//!
//! PARTIAL FIX + RESIDUAL (documented). At the raw GFA level, `pcut0` (a
//! full-footprint rounded-rect cutter whose outer wall is COINCIDENT with the
//! body's ±41.75 outer wall) used to make the assembler fail outright with
//! AssemblyFailed "no outer shell found (all shells classified as holes)" — the
//! #899/#911/#923 coincident-wall family. That catastrophic failure (the root
//! of the in-tool hang) is now FIXED: the honeycomb cap (pcut0's z=23 top) is no
//! longer over-covered by an invalid overlapping wire-builder partition, so
//! `Cut(body, pcut0)` returns Ok. In-tool this stops the multi-minute hang —
//! `cutAllBisect` no longer retries a throwing n-way cut by recursively
//! bisecting (re-running the expensive NURBS-faced `pcut1` each time).
//!
//! `honeycomb_cut_no_longer_throws` locks in that pcut0..3 all return Ok. A
//! residual remains: the cuts leave some free edges (an open shell), because the
//! cap's correct partition introduces vertices its NEIGHBOR analytic faces don't
//! yet share (a cross-face partition-consistency gap, not an assembler failure).
//! `honeycomb_cut_residual_documented` pins those residual free-edge counts so a
//! future cross-face-reconciliation fix is forced to update them (toward free=0).
