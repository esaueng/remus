//! Regression: the scoop-fuse-into-compartmented-bin result must be the same
//! whether the bin or the scoop is operand A.
//!
//! The scoop's bottom face (z=0) is coincident with the compartmented bin's
//! bottom cap. The same-domain selector deduplicates that coincident pair to
//! one representative face. The representative must be picked by geometry (the
//! larger, containing face) rather than by which operand is A — otherwise a
//! Fuse with the bin as A keeps the full cap while the swapped order keeps a
//! tiny scoop fragment and drops the cap, leaving the floor non-manifold and
//! forcing the mesh-boolean fallback (which tessellates the corner cylinders
//! away). Both orders must keep the 8 analytic corner cylinders.
