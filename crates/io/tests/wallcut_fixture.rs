//! Regression test for the gridfinity "2×2 wall cutouts" (U-notch) bin.
//!
//! Each of the four bin walls is carved by a rounded-rect prism that opens at
//! the rim (the cut runs from inside the wall up through the top edge). The four
//! prisms are fused into one multi-shell tool and cut from the shelled body in a
//! single boolean. The wall faces then carry a U-notch — a rectangular bite with
//! rounded bottom corners — whose top edge IS the rim boundary (open at the
//! top). The planar arrangement splitter used to reject those faces (their
//! corner arcs are curved) and fall back to the angular wire builder, which
//! traced one self-crossing loop per wall, left ~96 free edges, and forced the
//! whole cut to the mesh-boolean fallback (158 all-planar facets instead of an
//! analytic solid).
//!
//! The fixtures are the tool's literal operands (brepjs sketch+extrude geometry,
//! exported via STEP). A native arc-cornered rebuild does not reproduce the
//! exact prism/seam structure, so the regression is guarded with these.
