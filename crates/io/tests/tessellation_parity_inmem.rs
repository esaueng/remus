//! Tessellation-parity guards for boolean-result faces, replayed from the
//! gridfinity tool's literal kernel operands (captured via the arena
//! serializer during a tool probe).
//!
//! Two defects are pinned here:
//!
//! 1. **Ruled-direction interior grid over-mesh.** `interior_grid_resolution`
//!    fed a cylinder/cone face's `dv` — the axial span in millimeters — to the
//!    chord-deviation formula, which expects an arc angle in radians. A 28 mm
//!    tall hex-cut corner cylinder meshed at ~7700 triangles (one interior row
//!    per angular-tolerance step of "arc"), blowing a 2×2×4 honeycomb bin to
//!    ~63k triangles where ~4k is expected. The v direction of a developable
//!    band has zero chord sag; two interior rows suffice.
//!
//! 2. **Partial-band rim cracks at fine deflection.** Non-full-revolution
//!    cylinder/cone bands (the gridfinity socket-profile corner rings) fell to
//!    the snap mesher, which re-samples the rim independently and reconciles
//!    by 1e-6 proximity. At export tolerance (0.01 mm) its segment count
//!    diverges from the shared edge pool's, leaving ~200 one-sided mesh edges
//!    on the compartment cavity cut (non-watertight STL). Hole-free partial
//!    bands now triangulate via CDT over the shared pool ids, which is
//!    watertight by construction.
