//! Regression test for the gridfinity front/back multi-cavity compartment cut.
//!
//! Cutting two adjacent rounded-rect cavities (exported from the gridfinity
//! layout tool, hence NURBS-cornered) through the top cap of a bin box leaves
//! a thin shared divider. The second cut turns the top cap into a frame with
//! two holes; classifying that frame used to bounce its interior sample into
//! the second hole, drop the frame, and leave the result non-manifold — which
//! sent the operation to the mesh-boolean fallback and ballooned the face
//! count (~26 analytic faces -> thousands of planar facets).
//!
//! The fixtures are the tool's literal operands; the bug is sensitive to the
//! exact (spline-cornered) cavity geometry, so a native arc-cornered rebuild
//! does not reproduce it.
