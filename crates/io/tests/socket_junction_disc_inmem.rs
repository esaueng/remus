//! Faithful guard for the completed 4-way socket-junction disc.
//!
//! A baseplate's socket outline carries an r=4 relief circle CENTERED on each
//! cell corner; every cell's pocket contributes one quarter-cylinder of that
//! bore (a blind recess in the top band). Cutting the FOURTH cell around a
//! shared corner completes the circle, and the plate top must keep a DISC
//! face over it (outer wire = the four quarter rim arcs).
//!
//! The angular wire builder traces that completed circle as a standalone
//! two-arc closed loop whose pcurve-sampled polygon folds to ~zero area, so
//! the classifier's sliver guard silently dropped it — the loop COUNT matched
//! the planar arrangement's region count, the arrangement was declined, the
//! disc vanished, and the four rims went unpaired (GFA gate → mesh fallback
//! whose open output poisoned every later cut of the plate: the snapClip
//! join-edges export chain reached bnd≈1100). The arrangement gate now also
//! fires when any traced loop is area-degenerate.
//!
//! Fixtures are the tool's EXACT serialized operands: the 5×4 snapClip plate
//! slab and the four pockets around one interior cell corner, cut in tool
//! order (the fourth completes the junction).
