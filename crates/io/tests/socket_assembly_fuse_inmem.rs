//! Faithful regression guard: the bin × socket-assembly fuse at the z=5 base
//! interface. Operands captured from the live gridfinity tool via the
//! boolean-capture probe kernel (arena-serialized at the boolean entry).
//!
//! The export chain fuses the bin body onto the assembly of base sockets. The
//! two coincide across the whole bottom plane: each socket's top face is a
//! chamfered-outline square that same-domain-cancels against the matching
//! region of the bin bottom, and the webbing between sockets stays exposed.
//! At the four bin corners the bin's rounded-corner arc (r = 3.75) overhangs
//! the socket outline's chamfer, leaving a ~0.1 mm crescent of bin bottom
//! that must survive as a real face.
//!
//! The failure this pins: the wire builder hands the corner crescents back as
//! CW loops, and the hole-promotion pass probed a SINGLE interior point to
//! decide nesting. On a 0.1 mm crescent the probe slips across the shared
//! boundary into the adjacent socket-square outer, so the crescent stayed a
//! "hole"; hole matching then probed its first vertex (exactly ON a
//! neighboring boundary — unpredictable strict ray-cast) and dumped all four
//! crescents onto the first sub-face, one of them geometrically unrelated.
//! That face is same-domain-dropped, so every corner crescent vanished:
//! free edges at all four corners. The compartmented variant regressed
//! further — GFA's result failed validation and the whole fuse fell back to
//! the mesh boolean, whose output was itself non-manifold (the `1×4 2×8`
//! compartments, `1.5×6 ±40°` and `2×6 halfSockets ±40°` scenario failures).
//!
//! Fixed by deciding hole nesting from the whole sampled boundary (a loop is
//! nested only when every sampled point is inside-or-on the outer) in both the
//! promotion pass and hole matching.
