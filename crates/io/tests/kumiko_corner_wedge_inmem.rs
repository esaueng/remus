//! Cutting a kumiko corner wedge by one strut must stay analytic AND
//! watertight. Both operands are small coaxial revolve wedges about the same
//! corner axis: six faces each, two cylinders each, watertight and (since the
//! 2026-08-04 re-capture on a post-revolve-fix kernel) outward-oriented.
//!
//! History in brief: the original captures were globally INVERTED wedges (the
//! segmented-revolve winding defect, fixed in `revolve.rs` and verified in
//! `operations/tests/regress_kumiko_corner_wedge.rs`), and the cut fell to the
//! all-planar mesh fallback, which poisoned every kumiko corner band.
//!
//! Current state on the re-captured operands: the cut runs ANALYTIC in 2 ms
//! and keeps both cylinders — but it is WRONG twice over. Point oracles show
//! the strut genuinely OVERLAPS the wedge (B=Inside at (3.15, 0.2, 11.75),
//! which is inside A; the strut protrudes through the wedge's y=0 cap plane),
//! yet the result keeps the FULL wedge volume (285.861, nothing removed) AND
//! drops the y=0 cap, whose region is coplanar with the strut's boundary
//! there (the cap's interior sample lies ON the strut boundary; the
//! coincident-coplanar fast path defers straddlers and ray-cast says Inside).
//! The ignored test below pins the watertight goal state.
//!
//! Re-capture recipe: kernel-test boolean monkey-patch on a 1x1x4 mitsukude
//! corner-wrap generation; the wedge pair is the F=6 two-cylinder cut call
//! (four congruent instances, one per corner).
