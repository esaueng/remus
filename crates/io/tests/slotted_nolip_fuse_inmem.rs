//! Fusing the four-socket assembly onto a 2x2 slotted no-lip bin body must
//! stay analytic. FIXED by the within-rank cross-shell gate in
//! detect_same_domain: the fuse is watertight, keeps the full analytic mix,
//! and its volume equals the operand sum exactly. Historically it aborted
//! with "open hole shell with 45 faces", dropped to the mesh fallback, and
//! the fallback's open output carried 107-109 boundary edges into the
//! export (the `2x2 slotted no lip` export-integrity failure).
//!
//! Both operands are clean: the body (F=56, 8 cylinders, watertight) and the
//! socket assembly (F=136, 32 cones + 32 cylinders, watertight). Every other
//! boolean in the export chain replays clean and analytic; this fuse is the
//! sole leak producer. The failure reproduces identically on kernels from
//! before and after the 2026-08-04/05 engine work, so the trigger is the
//! tool's generator changes (the #3223-#3227 era) reshaping this
//! configuration, not an engine regression.
//!
//! Operands captured 2026-08-05 via the kernel-test boolean monkey-patch on
//! the failing export scenario (call 009 of 10).
//!
//! BK_OPEN_SHELL characterization: the aborting 45-face shell has signed
//! volume -51259 and is built from the BODY's own faces (src 10-13, the
//! outer walls and corner cylinders) — the fuse classifies a body-sized
//! chunk as a hole shell, the "no outer shell / misgrouped interior" family
//! rather than a small-fragment drop.
//!
//! ROOT MEASURED (BK_TRACE + BK_SD + BK_OPEN_SHELL): every free edge of the
//! aborting shell lies at z=21 — the top rim of the body's cavity-wall band.
//! All 191 classified sub-faces were Outside (nothing dropped by
//! classification); the missing face was the body's cavity CEILING Id(31)
//! (32-edge plane at z=21), which detect_same_domain declared a WITHIN-RANK
//! DUPLICATE of the body's exterior top disc Id(9) (8-edge plane, same z=21
//! plane) and dropped before classification. The two faces are coplanar
//! because the no-lip bin has a zero-thickness roof (the cavity ceiling and
//! the exterior top coincide), and the rank-agnostic geometric-containment
//! pass unioned them; the within-rank emission then treated group
//! membership as the #696 residue signature. Extent (edge-set equality)
//! and outward orientation were both tried as discriminants and REFUTED by
//! measurement: the honeycomb's true residue caps and this load-bearing
//! pair produce identical signatures on both (same_outward=Some(true),
//! coextensive=false). The discriminant that holds is SHELL MEMBERSHIP:
//! Id(9) lives in the body's outer shell and Id(31) in its inner (void)
//! shell — residue accumulates within one shell, while a cross-shell
//! coincidence is structural. detect_same_domain now takes the operands'
//! face-to-shell map and skips within-rank dedup for cross-shell pairs.
//!
//! EXPORT-LEVEL NOTE: on the conflict re-cast kernel (the O-shape fix) the
//! export test already passed because the chain's upstream booleans
//! classified differently and stopped feeding this operand pair into the
//! final fuse; the captured operands still reproduced the abort until the
//! coextensivity gate closed the root itself.
