//! Regression test for the gridfinity scoop-fuse-into-compartmented-bin
//! non-manifold.
//!
//! A faceted concave scoop-ramp prism is fused into a no-lip compartmented bin
//! (a box cut by two cavity prisms with rounded corners). The fuse goes
//! non-manifold three ways:
//!
//! 1. The scoop's sharp staircase pokes into the bin's rounded corner cylinders,
//!    so each tread plane meets a corner cylinder in a sub-millimetre ellipse
//!    arc. Those per-tread arcs must assemble into one continuous split curve so
//!    the cylinder splits into a lower band (engulfed by the scoop → dropped)
//!    and an upper band (faces the open cavity → kept). When the arcs do not
//!    chain, the cylinder stays whole, its interior sample lands inside the
//!    scoop, and it is dropped entirely → free edges.
//! 2. The compartmented bin's cavity walls are exported by STEP — and built by
//!    the tool's rounded-rect extrude — as planar B-splines (NURBS). Their FF
//!    intersections with the scoop's planes never enter the analytic
//!    plane×plane path, so the coincident/abutting wall regions never
//!    same-domain merge. They must be recognised as planes before the fuse.
//! 3. The scoop's bottom face (z=0) is coincident with the bin's bottom cap; the
//!    scoop's side faces cut footprint lines onto the rounded-rect cap, which the
//!    wire builder traces as one self-crossing loop.
//!
//! The fixtures are the tool's literal operands (brepjs sketch+extrude geometry,
//! exported via STEP), fused exactly as the tool fuses them: the compartmented
//! bin is built by cutting `bin_box` with `cavity_0` then `cavity_1` (NO
//! `convert_to_elementary` — the tool keeps the NURBS walls at fuse time), then
//! the scoop ramp is fused into that bin. A native rounded-rect rebuild does not
//! reproduce the exact prism/seam structure, so the regression is guarded with
//! these.
