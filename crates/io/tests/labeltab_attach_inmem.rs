//! Captured-operand regression for the gridfinity label-socket tab attach —
//! the fuse of the finished label tab into the 3×1 bin body.
//!
//! Operands captured on 2.127.29 from the warm-cache run of the "3×1 socket
//! auto-quantizes to 3U" scenario: GFA produced a 90-face candidate missing
//! whole faces — 8 free boundary edges — yet every remaining wire was closed
//! and the Euler gate balanced by accident, so `validate_boolean_result`
//! (which only hard-failed unclosed wires and non-manifold edges) accepted
//! the open shell instead of falling back. The same operands built cold
//! differ by float jitter and abort inside assembly ("open hole shell would
//! be dropped"), which is why the scenario passed solo but failed after a
//! 1×1 scenario warmed the cell-socket template cache.
//!
//! With the free-edge hard-fail in the strict gate, both variants reached the
//! watertight mesh fallback. The corner-crescent fixes (boundary-extension
//! salvage in `fill_images_faces` + the woven-spur arrangement trigger in the
//! face splitter) then made the fuse assemble analytically: the tab's square
//! top corners overhang the cavity's rounded corners, and the bin's top ring
//! must re-square there. The volume pin is calibrated by inclusion-exclusion
//! (bin + tab − intersect = 20462.5); the coarse-deflection measurement of
//! the analytic result reads a few mm³ low from chording its cylinder faces.
