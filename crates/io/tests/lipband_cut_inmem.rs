//! Captured-operand READY-REPRO for the custom-shape T lip band cut — the
//! operation that PRODUCES the malformed lip operand behind the T body+lip
//! fuse failure ("assembly failed: no outer shell found").
//!
//! The lip band is `cut(outer prism, inner frustum)`. Both operands are
//! well-formed solids: the outer is a T-outline prism (constant ±62.75 — the
//! capture calls it `lip-outerfrustum`, but its walls are vertical and its
//! corners are cylinders, so the fixture here is named for the geometry), the
//! inner a T-outline frustum widening ±61.55 → ±62.75 so that the two lateral
//! surfaces meet exactly at the top rim. The correct result is a band that
//! tapers to zero thickness at the top, with its z=-2.6 bottom a single RING
//! face (±62.75 outer wire, ±61.55 inner wire).
//!
//! What the cut actually produces is a bottom of TWO nested faces of the SAME
//! orientation — a ±62.75 16-edge disc (the target's bottom, passed through
//! UNSPLIT) alongside a ±61.55 26-edge disc — each with `inners = 0`. The
//! doubled boundary makes ray parity even, so `classify_point` still maps the
//! band correctly, while signed-volume integration double-counts: 20111.8
//! against the true 60735.9 − 54643.9 = 6092.0.
//!
//! The doubled boundary also makes the measured volume TRANSLATION-VARIANT,
//! which is the sharpest available detector for this class: this band
//! (bbox `z[-2.60, 4.40]`) measures 20111.8, while the identical shape after
//! the +15.90 z-translate the downstream fuse is captured with —
//! `lipfuse-top.bin`, same `F=98 curved=48`, same ±62.75 XY bbox, same 7.0
//! height — measures 65641.2. For a well-formed closed boundary the
//! z-dependent terms of the signed-volume integral cancel, so volume cannot
//! depend on position. Unlike a volume-vs-classification disagreement, this
//! check needs no second oracle: translate and re-measure.
//!
//! Two hypotheses are RULED OUT by synthetic controls, both of which are
//! correct today (single ring face, exact volume):
//!   * nested coplanar bottoms alone — box minus a nested box sharing the
//!     bottom plane gives one ring face and volume 3400.000 exactly;
//!   * the zero-thickness pinch alone — cylinder r=10 minus a cone r 9→10 over
//!     the same height gives one ring face and volume 303.687 exactly.
//!
//! The remaining differentiator is the non-convex T outline with arc corners,
//! consistent with the earlier layer map for this family (a concave corner
//! appearing as chord segments on one operand against a true arc on the other).
//!
//! FIXED (classifier depth probe): the band-bottom ring's interior sample sits
//! in the ~1.2mm annulus, coplanar with the tool's bottom cap.
//! `classify_coincident_coplanar` probed by stepping the wedge tip toward the
//! face centroid by fractions of that distance — overshooting the thin band
//! straight into the hole, so no valid probe was found and the unstable ray-cast
//! decided the ring was Inside and dropped it. A thin-band absolute-nudge probe
//! (staying near the tip inside the band) now classifies the ring Outside, so the
//! bottom is a single-covered ring: volume 6090.8, not the doubled 20108.8.
//!
//! Residual (benign): the band bottom tiles as ONE ring PLUS two tiny reflex-
//! corner (T-armpit) pieces — 3 planar faces, not 1 — from redundant coplanar
//! sections the FF-coplanar phase emits at the concave corners. The tiling is
//! exact (areas sum to the band annulus), position-watertight, and
//! translation-invariant, so this is over-segmentation, not the doubled-bottom
//! defect. The single-cover assertions below catch a regression to the doubling.
