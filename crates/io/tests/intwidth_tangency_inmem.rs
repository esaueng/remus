//! Faithful regression guard: the integer-width halfSockets wall-tangency
//! family (`compartmentBuilder.scenario.manifold` `1×6`/`2×6` halfSockets
//! variants → nm=76/136/140; `1×4 2×8-comps` → nm=12).
//!
//! Operands captured from the live gridfinity tool via the boolean-capture
//! probe kernel: the 1×6 halfSockets ±40 tilted-divider bin (95 faces) and
//! one wall-adjacent half-socket from the socket-assembly fuse tree
//! (34 faces), translated +5 in z to its final-assembly position.
//!
//! A half-socket outline's r=4 corner circles are exactly TANGENT to the
//! bin wall lines, and the outline's straight runs continue along those
//! walls from the tangency points — which therefore exist as exact operand
//! vertices. Two solvers recomputed those tangential intersections instead
//! of landing on the exact points:
//!
//! 1. `Circle3D::intersect_segment` solved the near-tangent quadratic into
//!    a root pair straddling the foot by sqrt(2r·δ) (a 1e-13 residual at
//!    r=4 shifts each root a full micron) — used by both phase EE and the
//!    FF closed-circle splitter.
//! 2. Phase EF's grazing edge×surface refinement lands anywhere inside the
//!    tolerance well (distance to the surface grows only quadratically
//!    around a tangency), microns from the junction.
//!
//! Both minted near-duplicate vertices ~1e-6 from the exact ones (above
//! vertex-merge tolerance), leaving micro line edges that three faces
//! shared — one of them out-and-back — so the analytic fuse failed the
//! non-manifold gate and fell back to the mesh boolean, whose output was
//! itself non-manifold (nm=76 at export).
//!
//! Fixed by (1) collapsing the near-tangent root pair to the
//! well-conditioned double root (the foot) when the chord implies
//! sub-tolerance penetration, and (2) snapping tangential EF crossings to
//! an existing pave vertex within the angle-scaled window when that vertex
//! lies on both the surface and the edge.
