//! Faithful regression guard: the halfSockets bin × socket-assembly fuse at
//! the z=5 base interface. Operands captured from the live gridfinity tool
//! via the boolean-capture probe kernel (arena-serialized at the boolean
//! entry): the final export fuse of the `2×2 halfSockets` bin (a 4×4 socket
//! grid whose four interior outlines touch nothing else — the disconnected
//! case; smaller bins have every outline on the bin boundary and never hit
//! it).
//!
//! Half sockets tile the base at half pitch, so the interior socket outlines
//! sit strictly inside the bin bottom, touching neither the bin outline nor
//! each other. When such a face is split by the planar arrangement, each
//! interior outline is a DISCONNECTED component of the trace graph and its
//! cycle is traced twice — once per orientation. Flat emission shipped both
//! traces (duplicate overlapping discs) and left the surrounding web region
//! without those outlines as inner wires, so the hole-less web geometrically
//! covered the duplicates. Same-domain detection then glued web, duplicate
//! discs, and the socket tops into one group and dropped every piece: the
//! web vanished, and the assembler's cap fill patched the openings with
//! membranes lying inside solid material. The mesh showed same-direction
//! half-edge pairs along every interior cell rim (boundary edges with zero
//! non-manifold edges) and a −13% signed volume.
//!
//! Fixed by resolving twin cycle pairs in the arrangement's flat emission:
//! a disconnected loop is emitted once as a solid region and its reversed
//! twin becomes an inner wire of the region that geometrically contains it.
