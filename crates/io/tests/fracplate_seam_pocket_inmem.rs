//! Faithful guard for the seam-edge (flush-wall) pocket cut.
//!
//! A fractional-width baseplate tile on a split seam extends its seam-edge
//! pockets all the way to the tile boundary, so the pocket's straight wall is
//! EXACTLY coplanar with the slab's outer wall and the opening must merge
//! into the boundary as a notch. The cut mesh-fell-back (F=122, 44 open
//! boundary edges at export tolerance) and poisoned the whole fractional
//! plate build (the dovetail `5×4.5 edge-y-1` scenario, nm=28 exported).
//!
//! Root: `find_point_outside_holes` built its hole-rejection polygon from the
//! stored `start_uv` of each hole edge, and a hole-wire vertex whose UV was
//! fitted in a DIFFERENT plane frame corrupted the polygon — the even-odd
//! test then accepted classifier seeds INSIDE the opening, both top
//! sub-faces sampled the cutter's interior, and the entire slab top was
//! dropped (Euler gate -> mesh fallback). With a frame available every
//! vertex is now derived from 3D, the same doctrine the function already
//! applied to curved-edge sampling.
//!
//! Fixtures are the tool's EXACT serialized operands (slab + the seam-edge
//! pocket of the 5×4.5 fractional tile).
