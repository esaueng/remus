//! Fusing two kumiko lattice bands aborts with "open growth shell with 67
//! faces" in 364 ms, from two clean planar operands.
//!
//! This is the smallest reduction of the mitsukude wall-pattern failure, which
//! the matrix files under `divider patterns` but which has nothing to do with
//! dividers: a 2x2x6 bin with the mitsukude wall pattern and NO compartments
//! and NO dividers already exports `bnd=4 nm=9`.
//!
//! How the export gets here (31 booleans, all replayed):
//!   - ops 0-28 are clean, analytic, `free=0 over=0`.
//!   - `op29` cuts the bin body (F=78, 12 cones + 24 cylinders) with 8 lattice
//!     tools and takes **99 s** to return `F=5716 ALL-PLANAR free=2 over=3` —
//!     every curved face gone, the canonical mesh-fallback tell.
//!   - `op30` then fuses that already-broken body and is pure GIGO.
//!
//! `compound_cut` batches by merging its tools into ONE solid first, so those
//! merges are Fuses — and inside op29 they fail **82 times**, 80 of them with
//! `open growth shell`, each dropping to a mesh fallback whose own output is
//! not a closed 2-manifold. This fixture is one of those merges.
//!
//! Same `open growth shell` family as the kumiko corner campaign, so the
//! `divider` and `kumiko` matrix families share machinery rather than being
//! independent. NOTE the parked `fix/kumiko-corner-window-cut` branch does NOT
//! fix this: the kernel that produced these captures was built from that
//! branch and contains all five of its roots.
