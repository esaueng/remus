//! Regression test for the gridfinity stacking-lip fuse (the default 2×2 bin).
//!
//! The bin body (a shelled rounded-rect tube) is fused with the stacking-lip
//! ring (a tapered rounded-rect loft, cut hollow) flush at the top rim. Their
//! outer walls are coincident, so the FF section lines on the body wall run
//! ALONG the lip face's boundary edges.
//!
//! The bug: when the section was additionally clipped to the opposing (lip)
//! face's boundary, the flush face re-derived an endpoint from its own geometry
//! with sub-tolerance float noise (e.g. -38 vs -38 + 1.4e-14), shifting the
//! section off the shared corner vertex this face's clip had landed on exactly.
//! The wire then failed to close and the assembler classified every shell as a
//! hole → "no outer shell found" → mesh fallback (≈200 all-planar facets with
//! no curved faces, instead of the 78-face analytic solid).
//!
//! The fixtures are the tool's literal operands (brepjs loft/cut geometry,
//! exported via STEP, round-tripping as exact cylinders/cones/planes). The
//! tapered 5-section lip profile does not reconstruct exactly from a native
//! rebuild, so the regression is guarded with these.
