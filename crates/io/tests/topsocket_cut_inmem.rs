//! Stage fixtures from the mixed-detail per-cell half-sockets chain, pinned
//! with the DIRECTED half-edge oracle (tessellate at export tolerance, count
//! half-edges with no opposite twin). That oracle is authoritative for the
//! orientation-mismatch class; the offset-classification "outwardness" audit
//! is NOT — it returns unanimous false positives near concave cylinder
//! corners (call 000's cut result audits "3 inverted faces, 10-0 votes" yet
//! meshes directed-watertight), the classification-probe trap in a new form.
//! Always cross-check any outwardness claim against the directed mesh.
//!
//! Attribution by the directed oracle (2026-08-07 stage capture):
//! - call 000 (cut, this file's `topsocket_cut_*` operands): args 0/0,
//!   result 0 — HEALTHY. The #1401 claim that this cut mints inverted
//!   faces was the false-positive audit; retracted here.
//! - call 001 (cut, `topsocket_chain001_*`): its args ALREADY carry 38 and
//!   78 unmatched half-edges (sum 116); the result carries all 116. The
//!   boolean faithfully preserves the defect, it does not mint it.
//! - calls 002-008: the 116 ride into the body operand of
//!   `mixed_socket_tess_inmem.rs`; the socket-assembly side stays 0.
//!
//! So the mint happens BEFORE call 001, in ops the fuse/cut monkey-patch
//! did not see — the export drives some ops through executeBatch (the known
//! capture gap). The next capture must hook the batch dispatcher too.
//!
//! What is proven about the defective faces: each meshes true to its own
//! effective normal (mesh_orient=1.0 in `fuse_orient`) while DIRECTED
//! pairing fails against neighbours at the quarter-socket rims — adjacent
//! faces' effective orientations genuinely disagree. Which side is wrong
//! needs a sound oracle before any fix.
