//! Faithful guard for the fit-offset groove-mouth sliver family.
//!
//! A fit-offset baseplate export cuts six connector grooves into the plate's
//! interior walls. Each groove's mouth clips the corners of the two adjacent
//! socket-pocket openings, leaving zero-width slivers between the groove
//! outline and the pockets' r=4 rim circles on the top face. Three variants
//! of the same root appear as the chain progresses, because each cut absorbs
//! its mouth pockets' rings into the top face's OUTER wire (bays):
//!
//! - hole 0: both mouth rings are still INNER wires — the promotion pass must
//!   pull them into the planar arrangement (their pave-split vertices lie ON
//!   the section lines), and same-component regions must not be re-attached
//!   as holes (double cover) so the sliver is emitted and classified out.
//! - hole 1: one ring is a bay — the bay arc must be split at its true
//!   circle×section crossings (the arc's CHORD stays clear of the sections,
//!   so the arrangement's chord-based crossing detection misses them by the
//!   sagitta) or the notch region traces to a phantom corner inside air.
//! - hole 5: both rings are bays — nothing integrates, so the bay-mouth
//!   arrangement entry (boundary-arc crossings + multi-hole cap) must fire.
//!
//! Also exercised: the fourth-quadrant corner cones' seam-side UV endpoints
//! (projected to u=0 instead of 2π, flipping the boundary window to its
//! complement so the cut's conics dangled and the cone never split), and the
//! reversed-traversal plane-arc split normalization.
//!
//! Fixtures are the tool's EXACT serialized operands (3×3 fit-offset loose
//! +0.2 plate after all nub fuses, plus the six groove cutters).
