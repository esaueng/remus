//! Fusing a socket assembly onto a bin body whose cavity has SHARP corners
//! must stay analytic. It used to abort with "open hole shell with 9 faces":
//! `shell` emitted NO inner face for a corner cylinder the thickness
//! swallowed, and the spec assembler closed the corner-wide gap by threading
//! the top ring's inner wire down the cavity verticals and across the floor
//! chamfer diagonals. That wire is edge-paired (free=0, so every health
//! check passed) but geometrically degenerate, so the next fuse's hole-shell
//! grouping correctly refused it. The fix emits the sharp-corner chamfer
//! strip (the collapsed cylinder's wire vertices mapped through the miter
//! positions), and the operands here are re-captured from the fixed shell.
//! Measured end-to-end: exported boundary edges 23/19/17 to 0/0/0 (1x1 wall
//! 3.8/3.9/4.0) and 20/20 to 0/0 (2x2 wall 4/6).
//!
//! Found via the gridfinity floor-pattern `oversized elements` scenario, which
//! is misfiled: its floor pattern is a no-op by contract and the plain bin
//! fails identically. The real trigger is `wallThickness` crossing the bin's
//! corner radius (`BOX_CORNER_RADIUS` = 3.75). Above it the cavity's corner
//! radius `BOX_CORNER_RADIUS - wallThickness` reaches zero and the generator
//! (correctly) emits a sharp-cornered cavity instead of a rounded one, so the
//! body loses its four cavity corner cylinders:
//!
//! | wallThickness | body faces | fuse |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 3.7 | F=19, 8 cylinders (4 outer + 4 cavity) | succeeds, F=63, free=0 |
//! | 3.8 | F=15, 4 cylinders (outer only) | ABORTS in 13 ms |
//!
//! Exported STL boundary edges go 0 -> 149 at exactly that step, because the
//! abort drops to `mesh_boolean_fallback`, whose output is itself open and is
//! consumed anyway (the long-open fallback-consumption defect). The later
//! export fuses then inherit the damage: replaying the captured chain, op2/3/4
//! are clean socket-to-socket fuses and op5 fails only because its operand is
//! already the poisoned all-planar fallback output (F=310, free=32).
//!
//! Both operands here are CLEAN (free=0 over=0, closed, outward), so this is
//! not the replayed-garbage trap.
