//! Faithful regression guard: sequential wall-cutout cuts on a 2×1-compartment
//! bin WITH stacking lip stay watertight. Before the #923 fix the second cut
//! dropped a contained back-wall and left free edges (the body mesh-fell-back).
//!
//! Operands captured from the live gridfinity tool (bin params: 2×2 width/depth,
//! height 4, 2×1 compartments, stacking lip, honeycomb wall pattern, four
//! u-shape wall cutouts) via the `serializeSolid` wasm binding.
//!
//! The tool's feature stage turns the four enabled u-shape wall cutouts into
//! TWO cut tools (`cut0`, `cut1`) and the honeycomb pattern into four pattern
//! cuts, then runs `Cut(Cut(body, cut0), cut1)` followed by the honeycomb cuts.
//!
//! Each wall-cutout cut is CLEAN on its own:
//!     Cut(body, cut0) → 150 faces, 52 curved, watertight
//!     Cut(body, cut1) → 120 faces, 44 curved, watertight
//! Both cutouts reach the same back-plane (x = ±28.385): cut0's tool face there
//! spans a wider y-range than cut1's, so once cut0 has carved its notch the
//! body carries a back-wall face that is fully contained in cut1's coincident
//! tool face. That opposite-oriented coincident pair used to hit the Cut
//! same-domain "overlapping → discard both" branch, dropping the body wall and
//! leaving its notch outline open:
//!     Cut(Cut(body, cut0), cut1) → 150 faces, **62 FREE edges**
//! The honeycomb pattern cut then ran on this non-watertight body and collapsed
//! it to 13 faces (tool mesh volume dropped ~60%, 21221 → 8497 mm³, and fell
//! back to mesh). The fix keeps the minuend's wall for an opposite-oriented
//! coincident Cut pair regardless of containment, so the sequence stays
//! watertight:
//!     Cut(Cut(body, cut0), cut1) → 156 faces, 0 free edges, analytic.
