//! Regression: cutting a gridfinity bin wall by one kumiko lattice band used
//! to leave 30 free edges, so the analytic result was rejected and the whole
//! kumiko family fell back to the mesh boolean.
//!
//! Root cause (diagnosed in #1223, fixed in #1224): phase FF's AABB in-both
//! pre-filter sampled each raw curve 16× and, for a `Line`, gave up without
//! the adaptive refinement it applies to every other curve type — on the
//! stated reasoning that a straight line cannot be under-sampled at that
//! granularity. But exactness of the LINE says nothing about
//! whether a sample lands in the tiny in-both WINDOW: the section here is a
//! full-height (~20.3mm) cylinder generator whose true in-both span is one
//! ~0.83mm lattice opening, under the filter's ~1.27mm pitch. Whether a band
//! survived was aliasing luck — 12 of the 16 band×cylinder pairs kept their
//! generator and 4 silently lost both. A straight section needs no sampling at
//! all: the predicate is membership in `bb_a ∩ bb_b`, itself an AABB, so the
//! segment is now slab-clipped against it exactly.
//!
//! This one boolean is the root of the kumiko export-integrity family. The
//! chain, measured (see the roadmap's goma entry): the tool's
//! `goma carves a 1x1x6 bin` scenario runs ~850s and trips vitest's per-test
//! timeout, whose abandoned async chain poisons the wasm kernel for every
//! later kumiko scenario — 14 failures from one root. Of that 850s, ~203s is a
//! single `cutAll` of 8 lattice bands, and it costs 203s only because the
//! analytic path is rejected and the mesh fallback runs instead. The analytic
//! path is ~12x faster and keeps all 12 cones and 24 cylinders.
//!
//! What the analytic result got wrong was small and precise: **30 free edges**,
//! chaining into **4 components whose every vertex has degree exactly 2**. Each
//! was an un-notched span of a corner cylinder's tangent generator at x=17.00,
//! left unpaired because the flat wall at y=−20.750 does have its opening
//! there. The notch — the quarter-cylinder trimmed from θ=90 back to θ=89.24
//! across the tool's 0.05mm `SLAB_OVERLAP` — formed in 5 of 8 z-bands on the
//! outer (r=3.75) cylinder and 7 of 8 on the inner (r=2.55) one.
//!
//! Diagnostic notes worth keeping: the failing bands are NOT distinguished by
//! the bridging ellipse's slope, band width, or band spacing (all three were
//! checked and refuted — the working bay at z 9.291–10.122 slopes the same way
//! as all three failures). And "only 2 of 24 cylinders carry sections" is
//! CORRECT, not short: localizing by the free loops' y/z rather than x puts
//! every outline in the single (+x,−y) corner.
//!
//! Bands 1/3/5/7 still abort with "open growth shell with N faces" — a
//! SEPARATE, pre-existing defect that this fix does not address.
//!
//! Operands captured from the live tool on published 2.128.2; the other seven
//! bands live in `~/.cache/remus-parity-captures/2026-07-24/goma-bisect/`
//! and replay via `crates/io/examples/replay_cut_capture.rs`.
