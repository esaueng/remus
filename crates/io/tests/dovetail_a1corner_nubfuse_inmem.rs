//! Faithful guard for the A1-corner dovetail nub fuse.
//!
//! The dovetail baseplate's corner nub is fused onto a plate whose cell-corner
//! junction carries an r=4 relief circle TANGENT to the plate wall x=42 at
//! (42,−4). The fuse must drop the plate wall's notched middle strip whole:
//! nub material sits flush against its entire east side (the bore touches the
//! wall only along the tangency meridian), so the strip is interior.
//!
//! The strip's splitter-computed interior point lands on (42, −4, −1.75) — the
//! intersection of THREE axis-aligned feature planes (the wall, the tangency /
//! profile-seam meridian, the dovetail flare plane). Every cardinal
//! classification ray from there runs along edges, seams, and the tangency
//! line, so all three parities were garbage and the strip classified Outside —
//! a kept interior membrane, a non-manifold analytic result, and a mesh
//! fallback for the whole plate chain. The classifier now detects that all
//! three cardinal rays grazed degenerate structure and re-votes with fixed
//! generic directions.
//!
//! Fixtures are the tool's EXACT serialized operands (corner-intersected 2×2
//! plate + the relieved corner nub).
