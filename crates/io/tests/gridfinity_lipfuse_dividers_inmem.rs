//! Faithful regression guard: stacking-lip fuse onto a COMPARTMENTED body.
//!
//! The dominant correctness gap behind the uncovered gridfinity scenarios
//! (honeycomb + compartments + scoop, wall-cutouts + honeycomb + compartments,
//! scoop + compartment dividers). Operands captured from the live tool via the
//! `serializeSolid` wasm binding (#915).
//!
//! ## What this isolates
//!
//! A 2×2×4 bin with 2×2 compartments routes the dividers through the
//! "multi-cavity cut" shell path: a rounded-corner box is cut by four cavity
//! extrusions, leaving the divider walls as residue. That cut alone is CLEAN
//! and fully analytic (see `gridfinity_cavitycut_inmem.rs`): the captured body
//! here is 38 faces with 8 corner/divider cylinders, zero free edges.
//!
//! The stacking lip is then fused onto that body. THIS fuse is the bug: the
//! interior divider walls poke up to the same z (≈23) as the lip base, and the
//! fuse fails to reconcile the divider-wall top edges against the lip-bottom
//! annulus. The raw GFA fuse leaves those divider tops as free boundary — 14
//! distinct free LINE edges, all at z≈23, tracing the interior 1.2 mm-thick
//! divider cross (x=±0.6, y=±0.6 spanning to the inner wall at ±39.25). The
//! result is an open, non-manifold shell, so the production boolean falls back
//! to a 228-facet all-planar mesh (every one of the 32 analytic surfaces lost).
//!
//! This is distinct from the previously-fixed plain-bin lip fuses
//! (`lipfuse_fixture.rs`, `scoop_fix_inmem.rs` 3×3): those bodies are hollow
//! shells with NO interior dividers. Here the failure is specifically the
//! interior divider-wall-top ↔ lip-bottom reconciliation.
//!
//! ## Fixed
//!
//! The body-top split now extracts the exposed divider cross. A holed planar
//! cap (the z=23 body top, with the four compartment openings as holes) cut by
//! the lip-footprint sections that bridge across the divider material between
//! those holes is decomposed via even-odd hole nesting on the woven planar
//! arrangement (`integrate_holes_plane` + `arrangement_regions_from_combined`),
//! so the under-lip ring classifies Inside (dropped) and the divider cross
//! classifies Outside (kept). The 14 free divider-wall-top edges are gone; the
//! production fuse is watertight and fully analytic again.
//!
//! The raw GFA fuse still leaves 8 free edges — short stubs (z=23 → z≈23.3) at
//! the four divider-arm/lip-inner-wall junctions, an out-and-back spur in the
//! LIP inner-wall faces that predates and is independent of the divider-cross
//! reconciliation (it is present on the plain shelled-cup lip too) and is
//! healed by the production sew/spur-removal pass.
