//! Faithful guard for the baseplate dovetail tile-join perf + non-manifold
//! defect — root-caused to the corner-rounding INTERSECT, NOT the connector
//! fuse. CLOSED (see the last doc paragraph); both tests guard the fix.
//!
//! The gridfinity tool's `baseplateGenerator.scenario.dovetail.test.ts`
//! "preferIdenticalPieces stays watertight on a corner tile with 2 join edges"
//! (the 2×2 A1-canonical doubled-dovetail) reported ~597 non-manifold STL edges
//! and took ~11 minutes per tile with remus. Capturing the tool's literal
//! kernel operands (via the `serializeSolid` wasm binding, replayed through
//! `arena_io::deserialize_solid`) showed the slowness is NOT in the dovetail
//! tongue fuse. The connector fuse is slow only because it is handed a
//! 5867-facet MESH-FALLBACK slab. That slab is produced one step earlier by the
//! corner-rounding op:
//!
//!     intersect(slab_with_pockets, rounded_rect_profile_extrude)
//!
//! The rounded-rect extrude emits its straight side walls as planar B-splines
//! (NURBS), coincident with the slab's planar walls. In raw GFA this intersect
//! goes non-manifold: ~45 faces, ~46 free + ~10 over-shared edges. The
//! operations layer recognises the planar NURBS walls and flattens them to
//! `Plane` (which removes the over-share), but the underlying intersect of two
//! coincident-walled solids whose only difference is the rounded corners STILL
//! drops most of the boundary (free≈74, only ~9 faces survive — three of the
//! four corner cylinders and most wall faces vanish). The resulting open shell
//! fails the Euler/manifold check, so the operations layer falls back to a
//! co-refinement MESH boolean → 6116 all-planar facets. That mesh slab is what
//! makes every downstream connector boolean catastrophically slow and
//! non-manifold.
//!
//! ROOT (verified, near-duplicate-vertex scan = 0, so this is the splitter /
//! face-selection doubled-face class, NOT the #859/#907 weld-or-same-domain-
//! near-miss class): the GFA Intersect of two solids sharing large coincident
//! planar walls, differing only by an analytic rounded-corner transition
//! (plane wall → corner cylinder → plane wall), mis-classifies/mis-splits the
//! coincident walls and the corner cylinders. Most boundary faces are dropped
//! (an open shell) and a few are doubled (over-shared). Flattening the NURBS
//! walls is necessary but not sufficient — the coincident-wall + analytic-
//! corner intersect itself is broken. This is the same coincident-contact
//! splitter family as the dovetail groove CUT (#938) and the scoop cases, and
//! needs a dedicated splitter/selection fix, not a weld/dedup pass.
//!
//! The two `.bin` fixtures are the tool's EXACT operands for that intersect:
//! `_slab` = the rectangular slab cut by 4 cell pockets (38 planar faces, clean),
//! `_round` = the same-footprint rounded-rect prism (5 plane + 2 planar-NURBS
//! walls + 2 corner cylinders). Replaying `Intersect(slab, round)` through the
//! operations boolean reproduces the mesh fallback natively (no tool needed).
//!
//! CLOSED: the final two stacked roots were (1) the FF-coplanar phase emitting
//! straight CHORD sections for the caps' rounded-corner boundary arcs whose
//! true arcs already existed as sections (a co-endpoint chord/arc lens the
//! wire weave cannot reconcile — `matching_arc_section_exists` now suppresses
//! the chord), and (2) section-arc T-junction splits normalizing their split
//! parameters against the `domain_with_endpoints` span, which is always the
//! CCW range — the LONG complement for the reverse twin of a section pair —
//! so a point on the circle 45 deg OUTSIDE the arc split the arc's interior
//! at a phantom vertex, breaking partition alignment between the coincident
//! caps (circle sections now use `find_splits_on_section_arc`, the same
//! shorter-arc convention as `evaluate_edge_at_t`). Both tests below guard
//! the closed state.
