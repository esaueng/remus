//! Deterministic work counters for complexity-regression guards.
//!
//! These count the *inner work* of the boolean hot paths that issue #987 found
//! to be O(N²) — so a test can assert the work grows sub-quadratically with
//! input size. Counting work (not wall-clock) makes the guard deterministic: a
//! reintroduced per-item full scan turns a linear count into a quadratic one,
//! which trips the bound with no timing flakiness.
//!
//! Five hot paths were fixed in #990; each has a counter here:
//!
//! | Counter | Hot path | Bounded shape with the fix in |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `pave_vertex_probes` | PaveFiller endpoint→vertex snap | spatial hash → near-constant per query |
//! | `sd_poly_clips` | `detect_same_domain` polygon clip | bbox gate → ~0 clips |
//! | `ray_geom_builds` | classify sub-faces | ray-cast geometry built once per solid, not per sub-face |
//! | `face_split_probes` | face-splitter section/loop scans | grid index → near-constant candidates per query |
//! | `local_vertex_inserts` | `build_topology_face` vertex pool | layered lookup → only genuinely-new vertices materialized |
//!
//! The counters are gated behind the `perf-counters` feature. With the feature
//! off (every normal and release build) the `bump_*` calls are empty `#[inline]`
//! functions that compile to nothing, so the instrumented hot loops pay zero
//! cost. The scaling guard enables the feature only for its own test build.
