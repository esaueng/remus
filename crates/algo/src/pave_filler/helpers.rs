/// caller checks genuine curve/surface incidence, which is what makes the
/// widened radius safe). If the accepted candidates span more than one
/// distinct position (beyond `tol_linear` of each other), the contact is
/// ambiguous — two different junctions inside the window — and `None` is
/// returned so the caller keeps the solved point rather than merging
/// distinct junctions. The spatial index uses cells at least as large as the
