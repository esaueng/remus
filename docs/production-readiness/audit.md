# Production-readiness audit

## Scope and evidence

This ledger records the manual production-readiness audit started from
`d2893af8807b2e7c6c52e90cba2a3ad9cce3bfa7` on 2026-07-18. At the start of
the work, `origin/main` and `upstream/main` resolved to that same commit.
The Codex Security workflow was explicitly not run; security-related entries
below are from source inspection and targeted reproductions only.

| ID | Severity | Component | Evidence and impact | Reproduction | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IO-001 | P0 | STL mesh import | Triangle indices were dereferenced before bounds validation, allowing malformed OBJ, PLY, GLB, or direct mesh input to panic after partial topology allocation. | Construct three positions with indices `[0, 1, 3]`; call `stl::import::import_mesh`. | Fixed: validate finite tolerance, positions, normals, triangle alignment, and every index before topology mutation. Regression tests verify error and empty topology. |
| IO-002 | P0 | IGES fixed-column reader | UTF-8 byte offsets were used as Rust string offsets, so non-ASCII input could panic. | Put `é` in an 80-byte IGES record and call `read_iges`. | Fixed: reject non-ASCII fixed-width records before parsing. Regression test added. |
| WASM-001 | P1 | no-I/O WASM feature set | `--no-default-features` referenced optional `remus_io` from BREP STEP methods and did not compile. | `cargo check -p remus-wasm --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features`. | Fixed: JSON BREP remains available; STEP import/export now return an explicit JavaScript error without the `io` feature. CI covers the variant. |
| WASM-002 | P1 | batch JSON handles | JSON integers above `u32::MAX` silently wrapped to unrelated handles. | Pass `4294967296` for a handle field to `executeBatch`. | Fixed: checked `u32::try_from`; regression test added. |
| PKG-001 | P1 | npm reproducibility | `npm ci` failed because `conventional-commits-parser@6.4.0` was absent from the lockfile. | `npm ci --cache /private/tmp/remus-npm-cache` before the repair. | Fixed: regenerated only the missing lock entry; clean install now passes. |
| REL-001 | P2 | WASM toolchain | Cargo pinned `wasm-bindgen 0.2.126` while xtask required CLI `0.2.121`. | Compare `Cargo.toml` and `xtask/src/wasm.rs`. | Fixed: xtask now requires `0.2.126`. A remaining improvement is deriving this value from Cargo metadata. |
| REL-002 | P2 | WASM release validation | Normal `wasm-build` validated files but did not run the Node runtime smoke test. | Inspect `xtask/src/main.rs`. | Fixed: normal builds now run `scripts/test-wasm-smoke.mjs`; CI invokes the command. |
| REL-003 | P1 | npm artifact licensing | The generated npm tarball initially omitted the repository license text. | Run `npm pack --dry-run` in `crates/wasm/pkg`; the initial listing had no license. | Fixed: xtask copies `LICENSE-APACHE` into the generated package, declares it in `files`, and validates its presence before smoke or publish. CI and the publish workflow run an npm dry-run. |
| GOV-001 | P2 | dependency scanning | `Cargo.lock` was ignored while OSV referenced it, producing unproven Cargo coverage. | Inspect `.gitignore` and `.github/workflows/osv-scan.yml`. | Fixed: root and xtask lockfiles are source-controlled; RustSec and OSV consume the checked-in graph and passed on the final PR head. |
| IO-003 | P0 | hostile-input limits | STEP, IGES, 3MF/ZIP, glTF, PLY, and batch JSON had no complete byte/entity/work budgets. Large inputs could exhaust memory or CPU. | Static audit of parsers and public WASM methods, followed by per-format limit regressions. | Fixed: all model readers use shared `ImportLimits` defaults (128 MiB encoded input, 256 MiB uncompressed 3MF XML entry, and 2,000,000 format-specific entities), expose `*_with_limits` overrides, and check declared counts before allocation where available. WASM batch input is capped at 16 MiB and 10,000 operations. Corpus fuzzing remains desirable defense-in-depth, not an unbounded production path. |
| WASM-003 | P1 | checkpoint handles | Bare arena indices could alias an entity created after checkpoint restore. | Restore a checkpoint, create entities, then reuse a post-checkpoint handle. | Fixed without changing the public numeric handle format: checkpoint restore retires post-checkpoint slots and preserves each arena's high-water mark. Stale handles remain invalid and new handles append above retired slots. Native arena/topology and WASM regressions cover reuse. |
| BOOL-001 | P1 | boolean/cavity semantics | Classifiers and some containment fast paths inspected only outer shells, so cavities were classified as material and fuse could discard a body located in a cavity. | Cut a centered box from a larger box, classify the cavity center, then fuse a smaller body into the void. | Fixed: native classifiers traverse all shells, analytic single-region shortcuts defer for cavity solids, and area/volume/center calculations include signed inner-shell contributions. Regressions cover classification, properties, and fuse containment. |
| BOOL-002 | P1 | boolean fallback contract | Mesh fallback could return open or non-manifold topology while public APIs reported a solid without quality metadata. | Exercise the known box/cylinder fallback fixture and inspect welded mesh boundary/non-manifold edges. | Fixed: fallback has explicit input-triangle, candidate-pair, and classification-work limits; topology-affecting maps use fixed-seed hashing; healing errors propagate; and open, non-manifold, or invalid outputs fail with typed operation errors instead of returning a solid. Regression verifies the formerly accepted invalid fallback now fails closed. |
| PERF-001 | P1 | repeated boolean determinism | The tracked 64-cut diagnostic documented `HashMap` iteration nondeterminism and an occasionally unbounded mesh-fallback path. | `cargo test --release -p remus-operations --test perf_64cut_determinism -- --nocapture`, run twice. | Fixed: topology-affecting boolean collections use deterministic hashing, mesh fallback has explicit work budgets, and the 64-cut test is an active required test rather than ignored diagnostics. Two release-profile runs produced identical per-cut results; the measured local run completed in 0.18 seconds. |
| NUM-001 | P1 | NURBS degree handling | Degree nine and above reached fixed eight-element evaluation buffers and panicked; maximum-order derivatives also exposed an incorrect Algorithm A2.3 bound. | Create and evaluate degree-nine Bezier curve and surface, including cached surface evaluation and degree-nine derivatives. | Fixed: evaluators retain stack storage for common degrees and allocate exact scratch storage for larger degrees; derivative bounds and degree-zero power-basis handling are corrected. Curve and surface regressions pass. |
| GEO-001 | P1 | curvature-adaptive sampling | The acceptance estimate used only endpoint curvature and the endpoint chord, so a strongly bowed interval could silently collapse to two endpoints. The corrected NURBS derivative implementation made the existing regression reproduce consistently. | Run `sampling::curvature::tests::high_curvature_produces_more_points_than_low`; the tight and flat curves both initially returned two points. | Fixed: sample midpoint curvature, use the maximum sampled curvature and a two-chord length estimate, and retain the depth-20 hard bound. Regressions cover bowed-curve refinement and explicit limit exhaustion. |
| TEST-001 | P2 | complexity instrumentation | Feature-gated work counters were process-global, so an all-features test run allowed unrelated parallel booleans to pollute the deterministic scaling guard. The isolated guard passed while the full suite reported 114 ray-geometry builds. | Run `cargo test --workspace --all-features`; compare with the isolated `scaling_` command. | Fixed: counters are thread-local to the synchronous boolean caller and use saturating increments. A regression verifies test-thread isolation; the isolated counter ratios remain unchanged. |
| OPS-001 | P1 | modifier/tessellation validation | Offset, fillet, chamfer, and tessellation paths could drop cavities or skip failed faces while returning success. | Cavity, all-failed blend, invalid topology, failed-face tessellation, and box-offset fixtures. | Fixed: stable v2 blend wrappers reject partial and invalid topology; builders preserve inner shells and treat no-op trimming/corner failure as errors; offset rejects unsupported cavity inputs before mutation, fails on missing assembly data, repairs adjacent face orientation, requires a closed shell, and receives comprehensive L3 validation; solid tessellation propagates every face error. Regressions cover each fail-closed contract. |

## Exit criteria

All P0/P1 defects found by this audit are closed with regression coverage. The
final fork-hosted PR run passed coverage, supply-chain, MSRV, WASM, packaging,
documentation, and aggregate CI gates. The branch is a **production-hardening
merge candidate**, not authorization to publish. See the stability matrix for
feature-level limitations and the release checklist for the separate package
release approvals and artifact record.
