# session, so a path that has gone stale sends a session to a file that no
# longer exists. Refactors that split a `foo.rs` into a `foo/` directory are
# the usual cause and nothing else catches them.
#
# Paths are matched as suffixes against the real file list, so both
# `nurbs/curve.rs` and `math/src/traits.rs` resolve.
